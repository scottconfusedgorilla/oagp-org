# install-claude-code-skills.ps1
#
# Installs the canonical OAGP skills (/oagp-bootstrap, /oagp-init,
# /oagp-onboard, /oagp-closeout) into the current user's Claude Code
# skills directory via Windows filesystem junctions pointing at this
# clone of oagp-org.
#
# After install, `git pull` in this repo keeps your skills current --
# the junction tracks the working tree.
#
# Usage:
#   git clone https://github.com/oagp-org/oagp.git
#   cd oagp-org
#   .\install\install-claude-code-skills.ps1
#
# Then restart Claude Code; the skills become discoverable.
